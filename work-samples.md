## Surface Profile Development

Passionate about making internal tools the best they can be for co-workers, I led discovery conversations for improving Surface Profile Development. After a half-day workshop in March 2022 and continued conversations with our primary stakeholders, I created the appropriate initiative, epics, and stories to encapsulate the work.

**The need for an experiment template specific to surface profile development was identified and created:**

It needed to be available only to certain internal users so the template is hidden behind an internal user role.

**This new template presented a unique challenge since a Brighton employee would need to be able to assign it to a specific client. We added an environment picker that only displays for Surface Profile experiments (and, therefore, internal user roles):**

### More improvements for folks who regularly develop surface profiles:

**Warn a user if they're about to overwrite an existing profile**

**Easily view a profile and all of its fields**

Working with internal stakeholders again, I gathered information about the best way to organize, order, and display surface profile data and then implemented a solution.

In the Surface Profile list, a user can select 'View profile'

The user is then taken to the Surface Profile view where they can expand and collapse sections to view relevant fields and easily copy the JSON from this page as well.

**Search Surface Profile list**

The list of surface profiles will continue to grow and now users can search by Network ID.
