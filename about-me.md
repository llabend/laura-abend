# About Me

 Oh hey! I'm Laura. :D

### A New Beginning
My journey into the tech world began with updating websites and digging in databases. I started self-learning how to code and eventually attended a software engineering bootcamp where I completed a certificate in Full-Stack Engineering. My first role was as a Quality Assurance Engineer, ensuring that bugs didn't make it to production. It was a valuable experience working alongside developers and it led to my transition into a software engineering role on the same team.

From there I've dug deep into learning all sorts of technologies, from infrastructure code and database querying, to creating API endpoints and processing data in the backend, and all the way up to fetching that data and successfully displaying it in a web browser according to design specifications. Still passionate about testing, I'm an advocate for maintaining our end-to-end test suite as well.

### Outside of Work
I love all sorts of adventures! Currently, my main points of interest include:
1. 🛠️ Updating a 1984 suburban house (read: All The Golden Oak)
1. 🛶 Exploring Minnesota for new places to kayak
1. 🥾 Hiking with my dog + spouse
1. 🛬 Visiting friends & family around the U.S.

### 3 Random Facts
🎭 I once towed a small puppet theater behind a tandem bicycle, performing for the curious souls of Michigan during their annual Tour Detroit bike event.

🍿 I have seen all 94 Best Picture winners. Frank Capra's 1938 flick, *You Can't Take It With You*, is my favorite of the bunch.

🎃 I've been a finalist in or won most Halloween costume contests I've entered.
