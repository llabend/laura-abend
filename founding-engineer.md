# Founding Engineer
As a founding engineer for BConnect Web, I've stretched into various roles including DevOps, Design, Product Management, and Quality Assurance. I'm comfortable wearing many hats to help the team keep moving forward.
- Bicep - to ensure we removed knowledge silos, I completed Microsoft Azure Bicep training and took over most of the infrastructure updates until the team grew and we could keep training folks on this skill
- I have contributed weekly to getting MVPs spun up and presented that work at All-Company Sprint Reviews where I field questions and feedback
- I regularly create stories & bugs as needed
- I am a proponent for and regularly contribute to our end-to-end & component Cypress test suites
- I participated in the engineer interview process, helping to identify a lead engineer and recruit another full-stack engineer to the team
- All of this and more directly contributes to the continuous improvement of BConnect to deliver an excellent product for our customers
